=head1 NAME

TextMate::JumpTo - Tell TextMate to jump to a particular file, line

=head1 VERSION

our $VERSION = '0.03';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TextMate::JumpTo qw(jumpto);
    
    jumpto( file => 'mysrc.pl', line => 123 );
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

On Mac OS The TextMate editor handles urls of the form

    txmt://open?«arguments»

which cause it to jump to the file, line and column specified by the
arguments. This module is a simple wrapper which uses the Mac OS 'open'
command to send TextMate to the specified location.

I use it in my F<~/.perldb> to have TextMate track the current debugger
position. Here's what it looks like:

    $ cat ~/.perldb
    use TextMate::JumpTo qw(jumpto);

    sub afterinit {
        $trace |= 4;    # Enable watchfunction

        # Needed to work out where filenames are relative to
        chomp( $base_dir = `pwd` );
    }

    sub watchfunction {
        my ( $package, $file, $line ) = @_;
        $file = File::Spec->rel2abs( $file, $base_dir );
        jumpto( file => $file, line => $line, bg => 1 )
          if substr( $file, 0, length( $base_dir ) ) eq $base_dir;
    }

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 C<< jumpto >>

Instruct TextMate to jump to the specified file, line and column. The
arguments are a list of key, value pairs:

    jumpto( file => 'splendid.pl', line => 12, column => 3 );

Possible arguments are:

=over

=item * C<file>

The path to the file to go to.

=item * C<line>

The (one based) line number to go to.

=item * C<column>

The (one based) column to go to.

=item * C<bg>

True to leave TextMate in the background. By default a call to C<jumpto>
will bring TextMate to the foreground.
